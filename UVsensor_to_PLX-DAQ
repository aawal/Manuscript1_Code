//Arduino Code for using PLX-DAQ to get data from GUVA-S12SD UV sensor


//always starts in line 0 and writes the thing written next to LABEL

void setup() {

Serial.begin(9600); // the bigger number the better

Serial.println("CLEARDATA"); //clears up any data left from previous projects

Serial.println("LABEL,Clocktime,time (s),sensorValue"); //always write LABEL, so excel knows the next things will be the names of the columns 

Serial.println("RESETTIMER"); //resets timer to 0

}

void loop() {

float sensorValue;

sensorValue = analogRead(A0);

Serial.print("DATA,TIME,TIMER,"); //writes the time in the first column A and the time since the measurements started in column B

Serial.println(sensorValue); //be sure to add println to the last command so it knows to go into the next row on the second run

delay(3000); //add a delay

}
